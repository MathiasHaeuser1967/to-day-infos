# Settings

The options are grouped into cards. Many cards have their own **Save** button – changes only take effect after saving **that** card.

---

## 1) Language

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Language** | Switches the app language (German / English). |

**Note:** The toggle in the online help changes only the documentation, not the app language.

---

## 2) Appearance

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Follow system** | Follows the system theme (Light/Dark). |
| **Light** | Forces light theme. |
| **Dark** | Forces dark theme. |
| **Dynamic colors (Android 12+)** | Adopts accent colors from the system/wallpaper (Material You). |

### 2.1 Accent Color (when dynamic colors are disabled)

When **Dynamic Colors** are turned off, a **color circle grid** with 12 Material 3 color schemes appears. Each scheme is displayed as a tappable color circle; the active circle is marked with a white checkmark and a glow shadow.

| Scheme | Preview Color |
|--------|--------------|
| Orange M3 | 🟠 (default) |
| Amber | 🟡 |
| Deep Orange M3 | 🔴 (dark) |
| Red M3 | 🔴 |
| Pink M3 | 🩷 |
| Purple M3 | 🟣 |
| Indigo M3 | 🔵 (dark) |
| Blue M3 | 🔵 |
| Cyan M3 | 🩵 |
| Teal M3 | 🟢 (blue-green) |
| Green M3 | 🟢 |
| Espresso | 🟤 |

The color schemes are provided by **FlexColorScheme** and automatically calculate all surface container colors (AppBar, cards, dialogs, etc.).

**Migration:** On the first launch after the update, the old Orange/Violet selection is automatically migrated to the corresponding FlexScheme.

### 2.2 Surface Blend Level

Below the color circle grid there is a **slider** (0–40) that controls how much the selected accent color blends into background surfaces:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **0** | Neutral, grey surfaces – no color influence. |
| **10** | Light tint – subtle color hint. |
| **20** | Medium tint – clearly noticeable. |
| **30–40** | Strong tint – surfaces take on the accent color prominently. |

The current value is displayed as a number to the right of the label. Changes take effect immediately across the entire app.

---

## 3) Display & Text

The **Display & Text** section allows individual adjustment of font and font size. All changes are applied **immediately** to the entire app and saved persistently.

### 3.1 Font

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **System** (default) | Uses the operating system's default font. |

| **OpenDyslexic** | Font specially designed for dyslexia with weighted letter shapes – a strong inclusion feature. |

Each option is displayed in the dropdown **in its own font**, so you can immediately see the difference.

### 3.2 Font Size

A **slider** with seven levels controls the global text size:

| Level | Scale | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 80 % | Very small – maximum space for content. |
| 2 | 90 % | Small. |
| 3 | 95 % | Slightly smaller than standard. |
| 4 | **100 %** | **Standard** – corresponds to the system default. |
| 5 | 110 % | Slightly larger. |
| 6 | 125 % | Large – good for impaired vision. |
| 7 | 150 % | Very large – maximum readability. |

Small and large **Aa** symbols on the left and right of the slider indicate the direction.

### 3.3 Live Preview

Below the settings, a **sample activity card** is displayed that changes in real time. This lets you immediately see how font and font size affect your task list before leaving the settings page.

## 13) Notes & Tips

- **Permissions:** Make sure **notifications** (and if applicable **exact alarms**) are allowed and battery optimization does not throttle the app – otherwise reminders may be delayed.  
- **DWD offline:** Without internet, DWD data is updated only when a connection is available.  
- **Multiple Save buttons:** Each card saves **its** area separately.  
- **Display & Text:** Changes to font and font size take effect immediately throughout the app – use the live preview to find the optimal setting.
- **Accent color & surface blend:** Color selection and blend level take effect immediately – no Save button needed. When dynamic colors are enabled, these options are hidden.
- **Overdue reminder:** Announcements are only spoken when TTS is enabled. The service checks for overdue activities every 60 seconds and speaks at the configured interval.
