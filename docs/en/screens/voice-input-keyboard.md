# Voice Input via Keyboard

With this input, you create an activity by **dictation** using the microphone of your **keyboard** (e.g., Gboard). You speak all fields in one go – the app parses the text and pre-fills title, description, date, and time.

---

## 1) Open

1. Open the **"Voice input via keyboard"** dialog or focus the input field and tap the **microphone icon** of your keyboard.  
2. Then speak your sentence (see structure) and tap **Done**.

---

## 2) Structure of the spoken sentence

Use the **keywords** as separators. **Order does not matter**, fields may be omitted:

| Keyword | Field |
|---------|-------|
| **"Title …"** | Task name. |
| **"Description …"** | Details/notes (optional). |
| **"Date …"** | Due date (optional). |
| **"Time …"** | Start time (optional). |

Example structure:  
`Title … Description … Date … Time …`

## 3) Content per field

### Title

Free text until the next keyword or until the end.

### Description *(optional)*

Details/notes. Also free text until the next keyword.

### Date *(optional)*

Supports typical formats:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Relative terms** | "today", "tomorrow", "the day after tomorrow" |
| **Weekday** | "on Wednesday", "next Tuesday" |
| **Calendar date** | "on October 22", "on 22.10." |

> **Note:** Speak clearly and without filler words.

### Time *(optional)*

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Full hour** | "6 pm", "7 o'clock" |
| **With minutes** | "18:00", "07:15" |

24-hour times are the most reliable.

2. Quickly review the recognized values and **save** the activity.  
3. Everything can be **edited manually** at any time.

## 6) Notes & Troubleshooting

| Topic | Note |
|-------|------|
| **Keyboard language** | Recognition follows the **keyboard language** (e.g., German). Set it accordingly. |
| **No app microphone permission needed** | Recognition runs via the keyboard / its provider. |
| **Quiet environment** | Speak clearly; avoid strong background noise. |
| **Privacy** | Speech is processed by the provider of the keyboard (e.g., Google). Check their policies. |
| **Fallback** | If something is not recognized correctly, simply enter the fields the classic way via keyboard. |
