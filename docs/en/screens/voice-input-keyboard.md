# Voice input via keyboard

With this input you create an activity by **dictation** via your keyboard's **microphone** (e.g., Gboard). You speak all fields in one go &mdash; the app parses the text and pre-fills title, description, date, and time.

---

## 1) Open

- Open the **"Voice input via keyboard"** dialog or focus the input field and tap the **microphone icon** of your keyboard.
- Then speak your sentence (see structure) and tap **Done**.

---

## 2) Structure of the spoken sentence

Use the **keywords** as separators. **Order does not matter**, fields may be omitted:

- **"Title ..."**
- **"Description ..."**
- **"Date ..."**
- **"Time ..."**

Example structure:  
`Title ... Description ... Date ... Time ...`

## 3) Content per field

- **Title**  
  Free text until the next keyword or until the end.

- **Description** *(optional)*  
  Details/notes. Also free text until the next keyword.

- **Date** *(optional)*  
  Supports typical formats:
  - **today**, **tomorrow**, **the day after tomorrow**
  - **weekday**: "on Wednesday", "next Tuesday"
  - **calendar date**: "on October 22", "on 22.10."
  Note: Speak clearly and without filler words.

- **Time** *(optional)*  
  - "**6 pm**", "**18:00**", "**7 o'clock**", "**07:15**"
  - 24-hour times are the most reliable.

  &rarr; Title "Jogging", Date next Wednesday, Time 07:00.

## 5) After dictation

- Tap **Done**. The app analyzes the text and fills the fields.
- Quickly review the recognized values and **save** the activity.
- Everything can be **edited manually** at any time.

## 6) Notes & troubleshooting

- **Keyboard language**: Recognition follows the **keyboard language** (e.g., German). Set it appropriately.
- **No app microphone permission needed**: Recognition runs via the keyboard / its provider.
- **Quiet environment**: Speak clearly; avoid strong background noise.
- **Privacy**: Speech is processed by the provider of the keyboard (e.g., Google). Check their policies.
- **Fallback**: If something is not recognized correctly, just enter the fields the classic way via keyboard.
