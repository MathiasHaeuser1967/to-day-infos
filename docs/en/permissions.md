# Permissions

Explanation of app permissions and required system settings.

## 1) Confirm installation

For sideload/USB installs confirm the system dialog with **Install**. (From Play Store this step is skipped.)

## 2) Allow notifications (Android 13+)

Allow notifications on first launch with **Allow** â€“ otherwise Android will **not** send reminders (cycles, time announcements, alarms).

## 3) Battery optimization: â€œNo restrictionsâ€

Exclude ToDay from battery optimizations (**No restrictions**) so reminders and (optional) exact alarms are triggered on time and not delayed/batched by the system.
