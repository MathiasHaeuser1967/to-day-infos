Welcome to **ToDay Help** (English).

ToDay helps you plan and remember activities â€” with clear lists, reminders/alarms, optional spoken time announcements (TTS), and recurring cycles. Everything runs **locally on your device**. No tracking, no ads, no online account.

---

## Quick start
- Install the app and open it once.
- Allow **notifications** and set **Battery optimization â†’ No restrictions** so reminders are not delayed.
- Tap **+** on **Home** to add your first activity. Set title, date/time, reminders, and optionally a repetition.
- Mark activities as **Done** when finished.
